* Use ```position: fixed;``` to position the cookie policy message at the bottom of the page
* When a user clicks on a city, alert the message "Loading weather report..."
* When the user accepts the cookie policy, hide the fixed message
* Challenge: When the user changes the ```<select>``` convert the temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit
